# Loginproject/Deployment using Docker 

Login project was a project that I worked on during my apprenticeship uses Springboot, Java, Mongo DB. 
This project allows a user to be created, encypted, and stored in a Mongo DB. 
Then user is able to login with the valid user credentials. Credentials are sent to the Mongo database and the credentials are 
authenticated and authorized to allow a successful login for the user. 

The project contains Job Functions - 2.5, 3.3, 3.4, 3.8, 4.1, and 5.5.

Imbedded in this repository is also the project I worked on for our Deployment Module. The goal of this project was to deploy an application
using Docker containers (I decided to use my previous login project application) and implement a CI/CD pipline that includes automated testing. 

This project contains Job Funtions - 1.1, 4.5, 6.1
